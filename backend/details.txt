If we combine Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet into a single platform, the resulting database structure would need to accommodate a variety of functionalities that support messaging, collaboration, file sharing, video conferencing, task management, and integration with third-party applications. The platform would likely involve multiple modules, each with different types of data, such as user information, conversations, meetings, tasks, files, channels, teams, integrations, and more.

### **Relationships Overview:**

1. **Users** can have many **teams** and **channels**.
2. **Teams** can have many **channels**, and each **channel** can have many **messages**.
3. **Messages** can include **reactions** and **reactions** are tracked on each message by user.
4. **Video Calls** have many **participants**.
5. **Users** can have many **tasks** and can comment on **tasks**.
6. **Files** can be shared among **users** and **channels**.
7. **Users** receive **notifications** based on activities in channels, tasks, and meetings.
8. **Meetings** can be scheduled and may include **video call links** and **participants**.
9. **Integrations** enable third-party services to interact with the platform.

### **Features Better than Existing Platforms:**

- **Unified Communication**: Messages, files, video calls, and meetings are all available in one place, streamlining team interaction.
- **Smart Notifications**: Automated and contextual notifications for team members to stay on top of tasks, meetings, and messages.
- **Cross-Platform Integrations**: Seamless integration with third-party tools like CRM, project management systems, cloud storage, etc.
- **Video Call Rooms**: Virtual meeting rooms that can be shared with external users, with the ability to schedule, manage, and record calls.
- **Task Automation**: Tasks can be automatically created from messages, meetings, or notifications, streamlining workflow and reducing manual work.
- **AI-Driven Assistant**: An AI assistant that can summarize meetings, follow up on tasks, and track team collaboration progress.

This schema should provide a robust foundation for building a platform that combines messaging, video conferencing, file sharing, task management, and external integrations—all within a single, unified platform.
